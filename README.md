## Development Environment
- Operating System: Mac OS Ventura
- IDE: Visual Studio Code 
- Compiler: Cmake files with VS Code

## Time Travel Days
- Number of time travel days used: 1 

## Extensions
- The system uses a live video webcam to capture frames and classify them.
- The system uses a new dataset ImageNet to train a pre-trained model ResNet50 to classify images.
- User interface: The user can press 's' to save a frame and classify it and 'q' to quit
- Similar functionality for the MNIST Fashion dataset (Not as accurate).
